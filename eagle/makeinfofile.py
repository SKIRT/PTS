## \package eagle.makeinfofile Creating information files with statistics on EAGLE SKIRT-runs.
#
# The main function in this module creates an information file with statistics on the results of an EAGLE SKIRT-run.
# The information file has a simple text format and includes statistics on the data exported from the EAGLE snapshot
# (i.e. the input data for the SKIRT simulation), on the SKIRT setup (such as the dust grid), and on the results
# of the SKIRT simulation (such as fluxes in various bands).
