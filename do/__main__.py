# Main module for the do package

## \package pts.do.__main__ Execute one of the scripts in this package from any current directory.
#
# Before proceeding, ensure that your login script includes the extra lines as described in \ref InstallMacSetUp,
# and that you have logged in again after that change.
#
# To execute a python script named \c example.py residing in this directory, enter "pts example" in a Terminal window.
# This will work regardless of your current directory.
# You can include command line arguments as well, as in "pts example arg1 arg2".
# You can shorten the script name to the first few letters as long as there are no two scripts with matching names.
# For example "pts exa arg1 arg2" would still execute \c example.py, assuming that only one script has a name
# starting with the string "exa".
#
# Use "ipts" rather than "pts" to enter interactive python mode (with the >>> prompt) after executing the script.
# This is useful for testing or experimenting with pts functionality: the script imports the relevant
# pts module(s) and initializes some key objects that then can be used from the interactive python prompt.
