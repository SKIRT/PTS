## \package pts.do.eagle.perform Perform the process for a given stage on a set of SKIRT-runs records.
#
# This script performs the process for a given stage on a set of SKIRT-runs records, in one of two modes
# depending on the command line arguments:
#
#    pts eagle/perform loop <stage> <runtime>
#    pts eagle/perform force <stage> <runidspec>
#
# where:
#  - <stage> is one of "extract", "simulate", "observe", or "store";
#  - <runtime> is a run time in seconds (given as a floating point expression);
#  - <runidspec> is a comma-seperated list of run-ids and/or run-id ranges (two run-ids with a dash in between).
#
# In loop mode, the script repeatedly performs the specified stage for a SKIRT-run record that is
# at the corresponding workflow stage and has the 'scheduled' status, until there are no more such records,
# or until the specified run time (given in seconds) has been surpassed.
#
# In force mode, the script performs the specified stage for each of the specified SKIRT-run records,
# regardless of the stage and status of those records.
