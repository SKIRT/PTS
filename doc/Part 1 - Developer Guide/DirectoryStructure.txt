/**

\page DevDirs Directory Structure

The <tt>PTS</tt> source code is contained in an online repository and can be obtained as described in the installation guide. 
The files are organized in a directory structure; your local copy may look as follows:

\verbatim
~/PTS
    git
        do
        doc
        eagle
        pts
    run
\endverbatim

The \c git directory contains an identical copy of the online <tt>PTS</tt> repository; it is usually placed inside a local
directory called \c PTS in your home directory. The \c run directory may contain input/output files involved
in actually running PTS. This information obviously does not belong
in the source code repository, which is why the \c run directory is \em not inside the \c git directory.

Immediately inside the \c git directory reside some shell scripts used for building and publishing the documentation.
In addition the \c git directory contains subdirectories holding the source and documentation files:
  - the \c pts subdirectory contains the Python source code for the core classes and functions offered by PTS;
  - the \c eagle subdirectory contains Python classes and functions dedicated to the EAGLE project but integrated
    into the PTS framework;
  - the \c do subdirectory contains a number of Python scripts that use the PTS facilities to perform concrete tasks;
  - the \c doc subdirectory contains text files with additional documentation that doesn't fit inside the source code.
