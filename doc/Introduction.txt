\mainpage Introduction

The <em>Python Toolkit for SKIRT</em> (<tt>PTS</tt>) consists of a set of Python modules offering functionality related
to working with <tt>SKIRT</tt>, the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code also developed by the Astronomical Observatory
at the Ghent University.

The <tt>SKIRT</tt> project offers state-of-the-art software code for simulating continuum radiation transfer in dusty
astrophysical systems, such as galaxies and accretion disks. <tt>SKIRT</tt> employs the Monte Carlo technique to
emulate the relevant physical processes including scattering, absorption and emission by the dust. The code features a
wealth of built-in geometries, light source spectra, dust characterizations, dust grids, and detectors, in addition to
various mechanisms for importing models generated by hydrodynamical simulations.
