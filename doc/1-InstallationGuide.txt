\section InstallIntro Introduction

This chapter describes how to install PTS on your computer.

\subsection InstallReq System requirements

PTS has been developed and tested on Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and on the Linux distribution Ubuntu 14.04 (64-bit).
However it should be able to run on any Unix system. At this time PTS has not been tested on Microsoft Windows systems,
however should the need arise this could probably be supported with only a small effort.

\subsection InstallComp Components to install

If you need to run SKIRT on your computer, through PTS or otherwise, then you obviously need to install it.
You can get the SKIRT source code and build the executable on your computer as described in the SKIRT manual.
If you just use PTS to pre- or post-process SKIRT-related files without actually running SKIRT, you don't
need to install SKIRT.

To run PTS you need to install the following components:
 - A Python distribution including the packages used by PTS: see \ref InstallPython.
 - The PTS source code: see \ref InstallSource.

If you plan to use PTS to create movies of SKIRT results, then you need to install the command line tool
MEncoder: see \ref InstallMEncoder.

To adjust or expand the PTS code, you just need a decent text editor -- preferably one with syntax highlighting
for Python source code. If you already have the Qt Creator development environment installed, perhaps because
you also work on the SKIRT code, then you can easily configure Qt creator to become your PTS development center.
See \ref InstallCreator.

To generate updated versions of the PTS documentation, you need to install the documentation generation tools
also used for SKIRT. Refer to the section in the SKIRT manual on this subject.


\section InstallPython Installing a Python distribution

PTS is written in Python and it relies on various optional Python packages; see \ref InstallPythonPacks.
To avoid having to install each of these packages separately (which is quite an undertaking), some organisations
offer Python distributions that include a selection of pre-installed packages.

PTS has been developed and tested with the academic edition of the Enthought Python Distribution (EPD) version 7.3.
(The limited public version called "EPD free" does not include all the packages required by PTS). The academic edition
of the full EPD fortunately is available to academic institutions at no cost. It includes a large number of scientific
packages, and it is offered as a one-click installer for various platforms.

Go to the <a href="https://www.enthought.com/store">Enthought download page</a>
and click on the "ACADEMIC" button at the bottom of the page. After entering your academic email address
you will receive a message with the download link. Download the installers:
PTS was tested with \c epd-7.3-1-macosx-i386.dmg on Mac OS X and \c epd-7.3-1-rh5-x86_64.sh on Ubuntu.
Finally run the installer on your computer following the usual procedures.

\subsection InstallPythonPacks Python packages used by PTS

The EPD includes a lot of pre-installed Python packages. The table below offers a list of the subset actually
used by PTS at this time. Future version of PTS may rely on other packages, as long as they are included in the EPD.

<TABLE>

</TABLE>

\note EPD 7.3 -- and consequently PTS -- is built on Python version 2.7.3. It does not use Python 3 because
some of the required packages are not yet available in this newer and slightly incompatible version of Python.


\section InstallSource Installing the PTS source code

\subsection InstallSourceGet Getting the code from the repository

You can easily get the PTS source code using shell commands in a Terminal window.
First create a directory hierarchy that will hold the PTS source code and run-time information.
The top-level directory can have any name (for example \c PTS) and can be located anywhere (for example in
your home directory), but the subdirectories must be named as indicated:

\verbatim
cd
mkdir PTS
cd PTS
mkdir run git
\endverbatim

Now obtain the PTS source code from the GitHub repository as follows:

\verbatim
cd ~/PTS
git clone git@github.ugent.be:SKIRT/PTS.git git
\endverbatim

To update the local copy of the source code after changes were made to the repository, use:

\verbatim
cd ~/PTS/git
git pull
\endverbatim

\subsection InstallSourceConf Configuring paths and aliases

It is important that your Python install can automatically locate the PTS source code, so that you can import PTS
modules regardless of the current directory. Furthermore it is handy to provide a few aliases so that you can easily
access PTS functionality from the command line.

To accomplish this, add the following lines to your login script
(if you are using the \c bash shell, this would be a file in your home directory
called \c .bash_profile or \c .bash_login):

\verbatim
export PYTHONPATH=~/PTS/git
alias pts="python -m do"
alias ipts="python -im do"
\endverbatim

The first line must be adjusted if your PTS directory is in a different place or has another name.

\subsection InstallSourceRun Running PTS scripts

To test your installation, run the PTS \em try script as follows:

\verbatim
$ pts try me
Starting try...
['/Users/pcamps/PTS/git/do/try.py', 'me']
Finished try.
$
\endverbatim


\section InstallMEncoder Installing MEncoder

MEncoder is part of the MPlayer opensource video player project. It is hard to find a recent pre-built binary
for the MEncoder command-line tool. PTS has been tested with a fairly old version that was apparently provided
for use in ffmpeg.

Locate and download the \c ffmpegXbinaries20060307.zip archive, most likely from SourceForge. (Ignore the installers
and projects depending on these binaries; look for the binaries themselves). The archive expands into two executables
called \c mencoder and \c mplayer. Copy the MEncoder executable into /usr/local/bin or put it elsewhere in your path.
You don't need the MPlayer executable.


\section InstallCreator Configuring Qt Creator for PTS

If you have the Qt development environment installed, perhaps because you're also working on the SKIRT source code,
you can use Qt Creator to edit PTS source files.

To enable syntax coloring for Python source code in the Qt Creator editor, choose the "Qt Creator->Preferences..."
menu item to open the preferences panel. On the "Text Editor -> Generic Highlighter" tab, press the
"Download Definitions..." button. In the new dialog, locate and select the "Python" item in the long list, and press
the "Download Selected Definitions" button. Close the dialog and the preferences panel.
