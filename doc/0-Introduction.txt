PTS consists of a set of Python modules offering functionality related to working with SKIRT, the
Monte Carlo radiative transfer code also developed by the Astronomical Observatory at the Ghent University.

This manual contains several parts:
     - The \ref InstallationGuide describes how to install PTS on your computer.
     - The \ref UsersGuide explains the overall philosophy behind PTS.
     - The \ref DevelopersGuide offers guidelines on how to extend or adjust PTS.
     - The Reference part documents every PTS class and function in detail.

This manual assumes that the reader has a working knowledge of SKIRT; refer to the SKIRT manual for more information.

The SKIRT web site can be found at <a href="http://www.skirt.ugent.be">www.skirt.ugent.be</a>.
