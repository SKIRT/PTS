<B>PTS -- Python Toolkit for working with SKIRT</B>

PTS consists of a set of Python modules offering functionality related to working with SKIRT, the
Monte Carlo radiative transfer code also developed by the Astronomical Observatory at the Ghent University.

This manual is structured as follows:
  - Part 0: Introduction (this page) and \ref LegalInfo.
  - Part I: Guides -- provides overall guidance and tutorials.
      - The \ref InstallationGuide describes how to install PTS on your computer.
      - The \ref UsersGuide explains the overall philosophy behind PTS.
      - The \ref DevelopersGuide offers guidelines on how to extend or adjust PTS.
  - Part II: Concepts -- offers extra information on selected topics.
    - \ref EagleGuide describes a set of functions for working with data produced by the EAGLE simulation.
    - \ref FitSKIRTGuide describes functions for pre- and postprocessing data for and from FitSKIRT.
  - Part III: Reference -- documents every class and function.

This manual assumes that the reader has a working knowledge of SKIRT; refer to the SKIRT manual for more information.
