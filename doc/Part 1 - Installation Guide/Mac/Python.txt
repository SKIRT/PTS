\page InstallMacPython Installing a Python distribution

<tt>PTS</tt> is written in Python and it relies on various optional Python packages.
To avoid having to install each of these packages separately (which is quite an undertaking), some organisations
offer Python distributions that include a selection of pre-installed packages.

<tt>PTS</tt> has been developed and tested with the academic edition of Enthought Canopy Python (version 1.5.1).
This academic edition fortunately is available to academic institutions at no cost. It includes a large number of scientific
packages, and it is offered as a one-click installer for various platforms. To obtain Canopy, follow the instructions below.

<i>Step-by-step instructions:</i>

<b>Make an account on the Enthought website</b>

- Go to the <a href="https://enthought.com/">Enthought website</a> and click "Create Account or Log in" at the top right.
- On the page that appears, fill in your information under "Create Account" and submit. It is important that you use your academic email address for your account! 
- Within a minute, you will receive an email with a confirmation link. Open the link to activate your account.
- On the Enthought website, press "Downloads" at the top of the page. Select "Canopy".
- At the bottom of the page, you will find a link to "Request a Canopy academic license". Click the link and press "Request your license" at the next page. This will grant you
  complete acces to the Enthought Canopy Python distribution.
