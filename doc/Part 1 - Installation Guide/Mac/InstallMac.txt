This section explains how to install <tt>PTS</tt> on Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite). To run <tt>PTS</tt>
you need a proper python distribution and the <tt>PTS</tt> source code, which is publicly available from GitHub.

- \subpage InstallMacGetPTS
- \subpage InstallMacSetUp

If you plan to use <tt>PTS</tt> to create movies of <tt>SKIRT</tt> results, then you need to install a command line tool
called "MEncoder". To install it, read the following guide:

- \subpage InstallMacMEncoder

To adjust or expand the <tt>PTS</tt> code, you just need a decent text editor -- preferably one with syntax highlighting
for Python source code. If you already have the Qt Creator development environment installed, perhaps because
you also work on the <tt>SKIRT</tt> code, then you can easily configure Qt creator to become your <tt>PTS</tt> development environment.
For instructions on how to install Qt Creator, you can read the topic in the <tt>SKIRT</tt> documentation listed below. How to configure Qt Creator for the development of <tt>PTS</tt> is explained in the second topic. If you plan working on an extensive part of PTS (or really any other python project), we can certainly recommend the PyCharm IDE.
The PyCharm Community Edition is freely available from the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">JetBrains</a> website, and contains a lot of powerful tools.

To generate updated versions of the <tt>PTS</tt> documentation, you need to install the documentation generation tools
also used for <tt>SKIRT</tt>. Refer to the following sections in the <tt>SKIRT</tt> documentation:
