\page InstallMacGetPTS Getting the PTS source code

To work with <tt>PTS</tt>, you need to copy the source code to your local file system. First create a directory hierarchy that
will hold the <tt>PTS</tt> source code, binaries and run-time information. The top-level directory can have any name (for
example \c PTS) and can be located anywhere (for example in your home directory), but the subdirectories should be
named as indicated below. Execute the following commands in a Terminal window to create the <tt>PTS</tt> directory in your \em home folder.

    cd [ENTER]
    mkdir PTS [ENTER]
    cd PTS [ENTER]
    mkdir run pts [ENTER]

As to which version of <tt>PTS</tt> you want to use, you have two choices:

- \ref InstallMacPublic, which contains the most recent <b>stable version</b>. This is the most easy way to obtain <tt>PTS</tt>, and if you don't have a UGent account, the only one.
- \ref InstallMacPrivate, which contains the latest <b>development version</b> of the code. This means that this repository is ahead of the public repository and contains all the 
  latest features. However, some of these features may still be experimental. Use only if you have a UGent account and you need a feature not yet present in the public version.

\section InstallMacPublic Using the public PTS code

The most recent stable version of <tt>PTS</tt> is available from the <a href="https://github.com/SKIRT/PTS">public PTS GitHub repository</a>. While any user can freely retrieve the code from this
repository (even anonymously), only the <tt>SKIRT</tt> team has write access to it. To obtain the code, simply type the following commands in a Terminal window:

    cd ~/PTS [ENTER]
    git clone https://github.com/SKIRT/PTS.git pts [ENTER]

This command will produce different kinds of output. To <em>update</em> your local copy of the source code after changes were made to the repository from which you cloned it, use:

    cd ~/PTS/pts [ENTER]
    git pull [ENTER]
    
If you plan to make code contributions, you should create an account at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub.com</a>,
fork the <a href="https://github.com/SKIRT/PTS">PTS repository</a> and then link this forked repository to your local <tt>PTS</tt> repository.
This allows you to push your modifications to your own fork and initiate a pull request when you want to contribute
the changes to the project. Refer to the <a href="http://www.skirt.ugent.be/skirt/_dev_git.html">Working with git</a> topic of the <tt>SKIRT</tt> documentation for more information. 

\section InstallMacPrivate Using the private PTS code

\note Some features in the private <tt>PTS</tt> code may still be experimental!

The current development version of the <tt>PTS</tt> source code is stored in a \em private GitHub repository hosted on the Ghent University's web servers.
You can access this repository only if you have a UGent account and the <tt>SKIRT</tt> team has specifically granted you read access to the repository. 
To obtain this access, first go to the <a href="https://github.ugent.be">github.ugent.be</a> webpage and log in with your UGent account name and password. This will create your account on the UGent github website. Then ask the <tt>SKIRT</tt> team to grant you the access to the private repository, providing them with your account name. If your request has been accepted, follow the instructions below.

<i>Step-by-step instructions:</i>

- Since you probably already obtained a copy of <tt>SKIRT</tt>, you probably also have a public SSH key added to your UGent GitHub account. If this is not the case, 
  follow the instructions in <a href="http://www.skirt.ugent.be/skirt/_install_mac_get.html#InstallMacGet__private">the SKIRT documentation</a>.

- When your SSH key has been added, you can clone the <tt>PTS</tt> source code from the private repository to your computer:

      cd ~/PTS
      git clone git@github.ugent.be:SKIRT/PTS.git pts

  \note Don't forget to add the extra "git" at the end of the last line!

- You will see the following output:

      The authenticity of host 'github.ugent.be (XXX.XXX.XXX.XX)' can't be established. 
      RSA key fingerprint is XX:XX:XX:XX:XX ... .
      Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 

- Type:

      yes [ENTER]
      
  You will see different kinds of output.
      
- To update your local copy of the source code after changes were made to the repository from which you cloned it, use:

      cd ~/PTS/pts
      git pull

- You now have a local repository (\em local meaning 'on your own computer') which is a clone of the remote repository (\em remote meaning that it is located on the web).

If you plan to make code contributions, you should fork the <a href="https://github.com/SKIRT/PTS">private PTS repository</a> and then link this forked repository to your local <tt>PTS</tt> repository. This allows you to push your modifications to your own fork and initiate a pull request when you want to contribute
the changes to the project. Refer to the <a href="http://www.skirt.ugent.be/skirt/_dev_git.html">Working with git</a> topic of the <tt>SKIRT</tt> documentation for more information.
