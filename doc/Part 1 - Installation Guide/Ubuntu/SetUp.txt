\section InstallUbuntuSetUp_path Configuring paths and aliases

It is important that your Python install can automatically locate the <tt>PTS</tt> source code, so that you can import <tt>PTS</tt>
modules regardless of the current directory. Furthermore it is handy to provide a few aliases so that you can easily
access <tt>PTS</tt> functionality from the command line.

To accomplish this, you will have to add some lines to your \c .bashrc script. To open the script, type the following commands in a Terminal window:

    cd [ENTER]
    gedit ~/.bashrc [ENTER]
    
Add the following lines:

    export PYTHONPATH=~/PTS
    alias pts="python -m pts.do"
    alias ipts="python -im pts.do"

Note that the first line must be adjusted if your <tt>PTS</tt> directory is in a different place or has another name.
After you save the file, you must log out an log back in for the changes to have effect.

\section InstallUbuntuSetUp_packages Installing dependencies

- Open the "Canopy" application. You should be logged in with your Canopy account.
- On the welcome screen, select "Package Manager".
- In the pop up window, select the "Updates" tab. On the bottom, press "Install all Updates".
- When the updates have been completed, select the "Available Packages" tab. Now you will have to install some additional packages through Canopy that are used by PTS. The screenshot below shows the output of the "pts depends" command (try it!), which lists all packages that are used in PTS.

- Not all these packages are necessarily required for your installation of PTS, however. The packages that you need depend on what functionality of PTS that you will use. If you are not sure about this, you can try to install all of the packages in the above list. Otherwise, you can run the "pts depends" command with the name of the PTS commands that you will use. A complete list of all possible PTS commands is obtained by entering just "pts" in the terminal. The screenshot below shows the (partial) output of this command.

    \image latex ptscommands.png
    
    For example, to check the dependencies of the "pts plotgrids" command, enter "pts depends plotgrids". The following output will appear:

    \image html plotgridsdependencies.png
    \image latex plotgridsdependencies.png
    
    An interesting option of the "depends" command is "--canopy". When this flag is added, it tells whether or not each package is included in the Canopy distribution. In the case of "plotgrids", run "pts depends plotgrids --canopy" and conclude that all of them can be obtained through the Canopy package manager. You can also add the "--canopy" flag without specifying a PTS command to "pts depends".

    A complete list of the PTS dependencies that can be installed through Canopy is given below:

    <TABLE>
    <TR><TD>AstroPy</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>config</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>h5py</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>lmfit</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>lxml</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>matplotlib</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>mpmath</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>numpy</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>pexpect</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>PIL</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>pip</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>psutil</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>pyfits</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>pyparsing</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>reportlab</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>requests</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>scipy</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>scikit_learn</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>scikits.image</TD></TR>
    </TABLE>

    Search for the desired packages from this list in the Canopy package manager and press "install". It is also advisable to open the package manager once in a while and update all packages.

\note Enthought Canopy -- and consequently <tt>PTS</tt> -- is built on Python version 2.7.6. It does not use Python 3 because
some of the required packages are not yet available in this newer and slightly incompatible version of Python.

- Close the Package Manager as well as the Canopy welcome screen.

- Some packages used by PTS are not available through Canopy (although we try to limit their use). This is the complete list of such packages (but be aware that you probably don't need them all!):

    <TABLE>
    <TR><TD>astroquery</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>imageio</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>montage_wrapper/TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>photutils/TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>reproject/TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>rpy2/TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>telarchive/TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>wcsaxes/TD></TR>
    <TR><TD>wx/TD></TR>
    </TABLE>

To install packages from this list needed for your PTS uses case(s), use "pip":

    pip install <package_name> [ENTER]

\section InstallUbuntuSetUp_run Testing PTS

To test your installation, run the <tt>PTS</tt> \em try script as follows:

    $ pts try me
    Starting try...
    ['/Users/yourname/PTS/pts/do/core/try.py', 'me']
    Finished try.
    $
