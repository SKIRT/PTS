## An instance of the SkirtExec class represents a particular SKIRT executable, and allows invoking it with
# given command line arguments. The current implementation only supports local execution; remote execution
# on another host will be added in the future.
class SkirtExec:

    ## The constructor accepts a single argument specifying the path to the <tt>SKIRT</tt> executable to be used.
    # The path may or may not include the "skirt" filename and if not, it may or may not include the final "/" of a
    # directory path. The path may be absolute, relative to a user's home folder, or relative to the current
    # working directory.
    # The default value is the empty path, which means <tt>SKIRT</tt> is looked for in the standard system path \c $PATH.
    def __init__(self, path="", log=""):
        
        # Set the SKIRT path
        self._path = path
        if not self._path.endswith("skirt"): self._path = os.path.join(self._path, "skirt")
        if self._path != "skirt": self._path = os.path.realpath(os.path.expanduser(self._path))
        
        # Don't invoke the multiprocessing environment by default if no MPI simulations are encountered
        self._domultiprocessing = False
        
        # Indicate no simulations are running yet

    ## This function invokes the <tt>SKIRT</tt> executable with the simulations and command line options corresponding to the
    #  values of the function arguments:
    #
    # - simulations: the list of simulations (instances of SkirtSimulation) to be executed
    # - recursive: if one or more simulations passed to the execute function contain wildcards in their \em ski file path,
    #   the recursive argument can be used to specify whether all directories recursively nested within the base path are searched 
    #   as well, using the same filename pattern.
    # - inpath: a string specifying the absolute or relative path for simulation input files.
    # - outpath: a string specifying the absolute or relative path for simulation output files.
    # - skirel: if \c True, the simulation input/output paths are relative to the \em ski file being processed;
    #   if \c False or missing, they are relative to the current directory.
    # - threads: a positive integer specifying the number of parallel threads for each simulation; if zero or missing
    #   the number of logical cores on the computer is used.
    # - parallel: a positive integer specifying the number of simulations to be executed in parallel (by means of multithreading); 
    #   if missing the default value is one.
    # - processes: the number of (MPI) processes to be used for the execution of simulations that are to be executed with MPI
    #   (this can be checked with the MPI() function of SkirtSimulation). This argument is ignored for simulation that should not
    #   be executed with MPI, whereas the 'parallel' argument is ignored for the MPI simulations (thus multithreading is not used for
    #   running different MPI simulations in parallel). The default argument is one, in case the particular simulations are still
    #   executed with the MPI executable but with only one process. 
    # - wait: if \c True or missing, the function waits until <tt>SKIRT</tt> execution completes and sends SKIRT's brief log
    #   to the standard console; if \c False the function returns immediately without waiting for <tt>SKIRT</tt>, and
    #   <tt>SKIRT</tt>'s log messages are sent to the null device.
    #
    # The function returns a list of SkirtSimulation instances corresponding to the simulations to be performed
    # (after processing any wildcards in the ski filenames), in arbitrary order.
