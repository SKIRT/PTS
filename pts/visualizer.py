## An instance of the SkirtSimulation class holds one or more SkirtSimulation objects, and it provides functions
# for automatically creating visualizations (such an SED plot or an RGB image) for all relevant output files
# in all of these simulations.

class Visualizer:

    ## The constructor initializes the list of SkirtSimulation objects held by the new Visualizer instance.
    # The constructor determines this list depending on the type and value of the \em simulations argument:
    # - missing: all simulations for which there is a log file in the current directory
    # - empty string: all simulations for which there is a log file in the current directory
    # - string containing a slash: all simulations for which there is a log file in the specified directory
    # - nonempty string without a slash: the simulation with the specified prefix in the current directory
    # - simulation object: the simulation represented by the specified object
    # - list of strings and/or simulation objects: all simulations in the listed objects, as defined above
    #
    # If the \em log argument is \c True, a message is printed for each file created by this visualizer.
    # By default, no messages are printed.
