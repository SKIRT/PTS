Astromagic, the new scriptable astronomical image editor. Includes magic features such as automatic star and background subtraction. Other features include:

 - Convolution
 - Rebinning and aligning
 - Plotting
 - Cropping
 - Rotating
 - Interpolating
 - Masking

Astromagic is intended to be an open-source, community driven project. 

The following prerequisites are required for Astromagic:

 - numpy
 - scipy
 - matplotlib
 - aplpy
 - pyregion
 - astropy
 - photutils
 - astroquery

It also requires the MGE_FIT_SECTORS package (Michele Cappellari) that can be found on this link: http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~mxc/software/.
The downloaded "mge" folder should be placed in a directory that is in the python path (you can always add a new directory to the "mge" folder by adding "export PYTHONPATH=~/mge" to your .profile file)
