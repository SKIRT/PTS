## \package pts.core.tools.archive Compressing, decompressing and transparently opening files from ZIP/GZ/BZ2 archives.

# The functions in this module allow opening a file contained in a ZIP archive without first extracting the file.
# It also allows compressing and decompressing .gz and .bz2 files.

## This function opens a text file in read-only mode. If a file exists at the specified path, it is simply opened.

# In both cases, the function returns a read-only file-like object that offers sequential access, i.e. it provides
