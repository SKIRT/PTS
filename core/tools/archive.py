## \package pts.core.tools.archive Transparently opening files from a ZIP archive.
#
# The functions in this module allow opening a file contained in a ZIP archive without first extracting the file.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Import standard modules
import os
import os.path
import zipfile
import StringIO

# -----------------------------------------------------------------

## This function opens a text file in read-only mode. If a file exists at the specified path, it is simply opened.
# Otherwise, the function looks for a ZIP archive with the same name as the directory in which the file would have
# resided, but with the ".zip" extension added, and it attempts to open a file with the same name from the archive.
# In both cases, the function returns a read-only file-like object that offers sequential access, i.e. it provides
# only the following methods: read(), readline(), readlines(), \_\_iter\_\_(), next().
#
def opentext(filepath):
    # if the specified file exists, simply open it
    if os.path.isfile(filepath):
        return open(filepath, 'r')

    # otherwise, try a zip archive with the same name as the directory in which the file would have resided
    directory,filename = os.path.split(filepath)
    zippath = directory + ".zip"
    return zipfile.ZipFile(zippath,'r').open(filename,'r')

## This function opens a binary file in read-only mode. If a file exists at the specified path, it is simply opened.
# Otherwise, the function looks for a ZIP archive with the same name as the directory in which the file would have
# resided, but with the ".zip" extension added, and it attempts to open a file with the same name from the archive.
# In both cases, the function returns a read-only file-like object that offers full random access functionality.
#
# In case the file is opened from a ZIP archive, the complete file contents is loaded into a memory buffer. This is
# necessary to enable random access to the decompressed data stream.
#
def openbinary(filepath):
    # if the specified file exists, simply open it
    if os.path.isfile(filepath):
        return open(filepath, 'rb')

    # otherwise, try a zip archive with the same name as the directory in which the file would have resided
    directory,filename = os.path.split(filepath)
    zippath = directory + ".zip"
    return StringIO.StringIO(zipfile.ZipFile(zippath,'r').read(filename))

## This function returns True if the specified file exists at the specified path and/or inside a ZIP archive with
# the same name as the directory in which the file would have resided, but with the ".zip" extension added.
# Otherwise the function returns False.
#
def isfile(filepath):
    # if the specified file exists, we are done
    if os.path.isfile(filepath):
        return True

    # otherwise, try a zip archive with the same name as the directory in which the file would have resided
    directory,filename = os.path.split(filepath)
    zippath = directory + ".zip"
    if os.path.isfile(zippath):
        try:
            zipfile.ZipFile(zippath,'r').getinfo(filename)
            return True
        except KeyError:
            pass
    return False

## This function returns a sorted list of the names of the files in the specified directory and/or in the ZIP archive
# with the same name as the directory, but with the ".zip" extension added. If both the directory and the archive
# exist, the two lists are merged while removing duplicates. The returned list is optionally limited to
# filenames that end in the string (or strings) specified as the second argument to this function.
#
def listdir(dirpath, endswith=None):
    filenames = [ ]
    # if the specified directory exists, list its contents
    if os.path.isdir(dirpath):
        filenames += os.listdir(dirpath)
    # if the corresponding zip archive exists, list its contents as well
    zippath = dirpath + ".zip"
    if os.path.isfile(zippath):
        filenames += zipfile.ZipFile(zippath,'r').namelist()
    # if requested, filter the names
    if endswith != None:
        filenames = filter(lambda fn: fn.endswith(endswith), filenames)
    # remove duplicates and sort the list
    return sorted(list(set(filenames)))
